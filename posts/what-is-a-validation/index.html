What we usually mean is to make sure that only valid data get accepted by the system. For example, a “create user” endpoint should not be able to receive a PDF invoice as input and create a valid user as a result 1.\nIn this post, let’s focus on the steps involved to get to valid data. Can we break down “validate” into constituent parts? Into simpler tasks? What is their order?\nTo answer that, let’s do a thought experiment. Suppose we have a web service accepting a JSON 2 input that does something useful with it. Before doing the work, it hands off the input to generic validation function that will validate input against some rules.\n(defn validate [input rules] ,,,) The actual arguments, return value or implementation is of no concern here. It’s very likely that your project will have multiple functions doing the work instead of just one, but that detail doesn’t matter here. What we want to know is: what can result in an error while attempting to validate input against some amorphous rules?\nWhat can result in an error? Not consumable. If input is an input stream then attempting to read the whole stream 3 into a byte array can fail. E.g if a client disconnected because they lost their network connection.\nEncoding. If input is a byte array then creating a string out of it can result in encoding problems. E.g. if the client sent CP1250, but the service is expecting UTF-8.\nSerialization format. If input is a string then trying to decode it as JSON can fail. E.g. when a client sent XML instead of JSON. 4\nShape. Top-level form might not match the expected shape. E.g. if the client sent JSON array instead of an object.\nRequired. The client might not have sent required properties.\nNot nullable. Required properties only mandate that they are present in a JSON object. They could have null value. That might not be acceptable.\nStrictness. Properties unknown to the system might be rejected. 5\nPrimitive value type. The property type might not match the expected primitive type (boolean, number, string). E.g. the client sent {\"datetime\": 1669637798}, a number, but the system is expecting a string.\nBasic constraints. E.g. number should be greater than 0, string should not be blank, string must have at least 3 characters, a regex doesn’t match.\nCoercion. Attempt to convert a primitive JSON type into your programming language’s type. E.g. convert to UUID, Date, DateTime, YearMonth.\nDescend. At this point, top-level form was verified correctly. However, nested arrays or objects might not be correct. Descending deeper in the JSON structure might yield the same errors from 4. Shape onward.\nProperty relationships. Now that each individual property in a JSON data structure makes sense (at any depth), make sure that the relationship between properties holds. For example:\nShipping information cannot be null if shipping type is :via-post 6 Product validity dates should satisfy $from \u003c $to Invoice total does not match the sum of all item amounts Basic DB constraints. The ones that can be easily checked or even implemented generically. For example:\nCountry doesn’t exist 6 Unknown product type Customer with that email already exists Business constraints. You know, the thing that makes the service be useful and not a simple API around the database. For example:\nNot enough funds in the bank account for money transfer 6 Cannot schedule the meeting because the person is out of office at the time Pregnancy tests are only available to our female customers Order cannot be canceled because it’s already shipped and on its way to you That product has been recalled in the meantime due to safety concern Cannot create a new reference to a note that has been deleted Referenced file no longer exists in the system Please load the currency rates for today before attempting to book an entry Generating this PDF would result in more than 1000 pages. Please constrain your dataset Cannot create a histogram chart from the dataset because it doesn’t contain field with timestamp type That flight has been cancelled in the meantime In order to import from GMail you need to log into your Google Account and allow access to our EasyImportApp The above is not meant to be complete. Depending on the problem you’re facing, you might increase the granularity even more or reorder the tasks. It can also be simplified up to a point.\nWhy think about it? Ok, “to validate” might mean many things. So what?\nWe can use that to improve the system. For example, suppose the system is responding with “Product not found”, but that doesn’t make any sense to you. So you start debugging, spend some time on it, and find the root cause. The error was supposed to be “Cannot convert product.id=‘abc’ into UUID”! Did the service implementation went from 3. directly to 12. and skip everything in between? To improve the system, simply add one or more of the tasks needed from above.\nEqually important is to think about the libraries that help out with the validation. Sometimes a library is used for absolutely everything without regards for what that library was designed to do. You know how it goes. Oh I see malli can handle a large subset of the tasks above, so let’s also beat it into submission and make it handle business constraints. It’s important to acknowledge their limits. It’s unlikely that any open source library will help you with your business constraints. You need to make room in your project to handle them properly. More on that in the next blog post.\nAppendix If you happen to implement your system such that it recognizes all the relevant subtasks above then a nice side benefit is that it’s really easy to explore and course-correct using such a system. Event without any documentation. For example, you can keep executing curl -X POST https://api.company.com/users -H '...' -d '...' and learn something new.\nOh I see I need to send something Oh it needs to be a JSON Oh a JSON object Oh email and dateOfBirth are required Oh dateOfBirth needs to be a string Oh email needs to match a regex Oh dateOfBirth needs to be in ISO8601 format Does it accept time information? No! Oh john@example.com already exists … and so on If you’ve ever used a system that guided you towards a solution, you know how lovely it is to use it. On the other hand, if you’ve done that on the service side, you know that careful error handling usually corresponds with proportional reduction in time consumed by debugging.\nUsually anyway. I don’t know your project. :) ↩︎\nWe’ll use JSON because it’s so common. The thought experiment should work equally well with EDN, XML, protocol buffers, or any other serialization format. ↩︎\nWe won’t concern ourselves with optimizations such as performance, latency, or memory requirements.
